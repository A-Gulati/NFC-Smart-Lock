# NFC-Smart-Lock

This project focuses on developing an NFC Smart Lock System that utilizes a smart phoneâ€™s onboard NFC chip as a method to unlock a door. Access is regulated using a central server which runs a simple user interface that allows an administrator to grant or deny entry to any particular user. The smart lock PCB interfaces with the server via a Wi-Fi module communicating with the TCP/IP protocol.
The goal for this project was to prototype a simple, reliable, and convenient lock mechanism that adds functionality to existing locks by integrating modern technology with the ancient and pervasive concept of door locks. This report details the design, testing, and conclusions that resulted from working toward accomplishing the aforementioned objectives.
